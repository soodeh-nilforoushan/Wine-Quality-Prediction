# Wine-Quality-Prediction

In this project we have experimented with 10 classifier machine learning models to predict the quality of wine from their ingredients. We have also analysed how the performance of models
change along with the changes in the dataset. We experimented all these by operating several operations on the dataset like applying models on the data sets by oversampling the data or comparing the models on the same dataset with different hyper parameters. This project has given much insight on the knowledge required for analysing a dataset.
